My name is Erdenechimeg. I am an amateur data analyst and a busy mama at the moment. 
I grew up in Ulaanbaatar and currently live in Stockholm. 
I have a background in physics and got my PhD in reactor physics in 2014. 
Here is a link to my [PhD thesis](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:727866/FULLTEXT01.pdf).   
<I strongly believe in facts presented by careful numerical analyses.>
